        <h3>Project aims </h3>
        <p> This project seeks to understand the plastic waste trade and plastic pollution through the lens of waste colonialism. 
            The term 'waste colonialism' refers to the practice of exporting waste from high income to low income countries. The key question I want to ask is, how much of our plastic waste ends up in the ocean?
        
        <p>  Following China's plastic import ban in 2020, Malaysia and several other developing countries, such as Vietnam and Turkey, 
            became the top destination for plastic waste from developed countries. At the same time, mainstream media frequently blames 
            these countries for being the world's large polluters of plastic waste, when these are actually outsourced from developed nations.
        </p>

        <p>  However, despite throughout the project, data showed interesting trends. An important insight was the fact that we must acknowledge

        <h3>Accessibility of data sources </h3>
        <p> <b>Data sources:</b></p>
        
        <p>Given increasing global concerns regarding plastic pollution, I leveraged various sources to obtain the necessary data for my visualisation project.
                 Using the programming skills acquired in PP434, such as Python and Vegalite, I was able to access and clean large datasets relevant to plastic waste. 
                </p>
                 <p>
                    The first approach involved automated data extraction, where I used APIs from Our World in Data (OWID) and the World Bank (TWB). 
                OWID was especially useful as the platform had already processed certain datasets relevant to my project, while TWB provided comprehensive data such as population size and GDP.
                 </p>
                 <p>
                  I supplemented the first approach by manually downloading other relevant data related to plastic waste from UN Comtrade, UN Trade and Development (UNCTAD),  UNEP's Global Partnership on Plastic Pollution and Marine Litter (GPML), and the National Centers for Environmental Information (NCEI).

        <h3>Section 1: Plastic consumption across time</h3>
        <h4>How has waste generation change across countries and regions in the past decade?</h4>
        <p> The following visualisations seek to illustrate the plastic waste generated per capita in 2010 and 2023, highlighting how the world is increasingly consuming more plastic.
            The first chart uses data that was processed by Our World in Data (OWD) to capture the daily plastic waste generation per person, measured in kg. 
            Given that the original data was from a research paper, there were no subsequent data to show a comparison. 
        </p>

        <p>Thus, I used data from various sources to create a similar visualisation for 2023 using Python. The main dataset was then merged with GDP and population data that I fetched using the World Bank API in Python. Due to limited data, however,
            I could only find data based on annual plastic waste emitted per capita in 2023, instead of daily waste.  </p>

        <h3>Section 2: Trends in plastic waste imports and exports</h3>
        <h4></h4>
        <p> The following charts explore the broader trends in plastic waste imports and exports at the international level, using The World Bank's classification of four income groups: low, lower-middle, upper-middle, and high-income countries.
            The selection tool allows us to compare across countries based on their income groups. </p>

    <p>High income countries have consistently exported high amounts of plastic waste, while upper middle income countries imported high amounts of plastic waste.
        However, we see a change after 2017, where high income countries started to import more waste, while the amount of waste imported by upper middle-income countries declined significantly. This is likely due to the import ban imposed by China in 2017.

            Now that we have observed the trends in plastic waste imports and exports at the international level, we can look at which countries are among the top exporters and importers. I used Python in Google Colab to clean and filter the raw data from UN Comtrade.

            <p>Similar to our observation in Section 2, we observe that all of the top exporters are high-income countries, although the top importers consists of both high and middle-income countries. </p>

            Once plastic waste is exported, what will happen to them in receiving countries? The following graph visualises how plastic waste is recycled, 
            incinerated, landfilled, and littered and mismanaged. I accessed the data via OWID's API in Python and cleaned the data based on the relevant information.  </p>

        <h3>Challenges</h3>
            <p><ul> One of the key issues I encountered during the project was when I attempted to use the UN Comtrade API in Python, despite the API being publicly available and retrieving my subscription key. 
                To overcome this, I manually downloaded the data required in CSV format through the UN Comtrade’s website and filtered the relevant data for my project. 
                The API for other websites, such as UNCTAD, was only available in R, while the other data sources did not have API. Thus, I had to manually download, clean, and process these datasets in Python. 
                </ul></p>
                <p><ul>
                    Despite the large amount of data on plastic waste, most of these datasets were inconsistent and I encountered a lot of missing values, such as ISO3 codes for some of the datasets. 
                    I turned to Python libraries to address these challenges, such as by using pandas and py country to conduct data manipulation and analysis.                 </ul></p>
                <p><ul>
                    Furthermore, there was also limited data on plastic waste for smaller and low-income countries, which may not accurately reflect the plastic pollution issue in these respective countries.           </ul></p>
           </ul>
        </p>

        <h3>Conclusion</h3>
        <p><ul> Globally, plastic waste consumption is increasing and will continue to increase in the foreseeable future, as illustrated in Section 1. 
            With increasing consumption, trade in plastic waste will increase, resulting in irreversible implications for the environment and wider society.
            </ul></p>
        <p><ul> As portrayed by the visualisations in Sections 2 – 4, there is also some element of waste colonialism in the plastic waste trade. 
            Top exporters of plastic waste are mostly high-income countries, while the importing countries are middle-income countries that may lack the proper infrastructure to recycle or sustainably dispose of plastic waste. 
            Thus, they effectively become a dumping site for richer countries. This calls for further work to examine the destinations of plastic waste from top exporters. 
        </ul></p>
        <p><ul>The amount of plastic waste emitted into the ocean, which later disintegrates into microplastics, is an alarming phenomenon with wide-reaching environmental and health implications. 
            Policy intervention is therefore necessary to address the root causes of plastic pollution, with a specific focus on equitable solutions that promote environmental justice.
