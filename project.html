        <h3>Project </h3>
        <p> This project seeks to understand the plastic waste trade and plastic pollution through the lens of waste colonialism. 
            The term 'waste colonialism' refers to the practice of exporting waste from high income to low income countries.
            
        <p>  Following China's plastic import ban in 2020, Malaysia and several other developing countries, such as Vietnam and Turkey, 
            became the top destination for plastic waste from developed countries. At the same time, mainstream media frequently blames 
            these countries for being the world's large polluters of plastic waste, when these are actually outsourced from developed nations.

        <p>  However, despite throughout the project, data showed interesting trends. An important insight was the fact that we must acknowledge
