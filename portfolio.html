                In the first week, I learned the basics of Github and familiarized myself with Vegalite. I explored the different types of chart options available and experimented with different visualisations.
                The first chart is taken from Rapidcharts.io and illustrates the relationship between GDP and life expectancy around the world.

                The following chart shows the trends in spending on various food categories, such as bread and cereals, meat, fish, fruit, and sugar and confectionery. From the chart, we can also deduce how British consumers have spent money on food in the UK. I used data from the Office for National Statistics (ONS).

                Among the topics discussed at the Festival of Economics was low productivity. This section uses Japan as a case study given its longstanding challenges with productivity. 

                The charts support the topic discussed. Despite relatively high capital stock, productivity has consistently remained low since the 1980s, indicating that it may be due to structural issues in the economy.            </p>
